Installation instructions
=========================

To install,

To install the latest stable version of PyDeco, you can use pip in a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U pydeco

Alternatively, you can clone the github repo and `cd` to the its root
directory. Then simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .


.. tip::
    Note: the `-e` tag is optional and allows installing the package in `develop
    mode <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35064426/when-would-be-e-editable-option-useful-with-pip-install>`_.
    This mode will just link the package to the original location on disk, such
    that any local changes to the package would reflect directly in your
    environment (and would not require a `pip` reinstall).
